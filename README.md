# Smart Scale Food Tracker

A smart scale build with Arduino and/or Raspberry Pi to automate tracking calories &amp; macros.

It's goal is to minimize the effort of tracking food. Espacially when you want to do it on a daily basis it can get annoying to get everything in place and start the procedure. Therefore you often see people quit tracking food after a few days or weeks, loosing sight of their food intake.

There is no need to fill in everything manually. The scale will measure it's weight and a camera classifies the food with image recognition. All information will be sent automatically to an API that recieves the desired data like calories, proteins, fat, carbs. It should also be possible to scan barcodes when available.

This project is in it's initial stage.
